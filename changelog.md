# changelog

all notable project changes are documented here.

## unreleased

### added
- docs sync marker in `visor.forge.md` to explicitly track when implementation changes are mirrored into roadmap-facing docs.
- process reminder in forge notes: implementation change -> forge log update + README status note + changelog entry for user-visible impact.

### changed
- `README.md` now explicitly notes that M12 iteration 3 included post-research hardening (`validate_openai` setup action + `levelup_preset = "recommended"`).
- `visor.forge.md` now includes a 2026-02-21 sync note tying recent setup hardening changes back to the project timeline.
